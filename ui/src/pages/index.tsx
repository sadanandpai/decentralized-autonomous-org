            Welcome to Decentralized Autonomous Organization
          </h2>
          <p className="mt-8 mb-8">
            DAO is an acronym for decentralised autonomous organisation. It is the web3 scheme for a
            way a decentralised company should run. In a DAO all decisions are based on a quorum and
            all money flow is on the blockchain. This is a Dapp that DAOs can use for proposing and
            voting on decisions.
          </p>
          <div className="mb-8">
            <p className="mb-2">
              <strong>Stage 0:</strong> A user must be inducted as a member of the DAO with their
              profile. The profile must be linked to the userâ€™s wallet and contain other information
              about them. Bonus points for a well-rounded profile with a profile picture and other
              data (stored in a decentralised manner).
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              <strong>Stage 1: </strong>One member can initiate a proposal by uploading the
              necessary details. This proposal may have attachments and several descriptive fields.
              Remember all data must be stored in a decentralised manner.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              <strong>Stage 2: </strong>Once a proposal is uploaded, the other members may be
              notified and the voting process begins. A time is set for all members to finish
              voting. After timeout voting closes and results are tallied. The voting period is
              extended if only less than 80% of the members have voted.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-2">
              <strong>Stage 3: </strong>The voting is transparent and all members will be able to
              see the results and the proposal is accepted or rejected based on a predetermined
              threshold majority.
