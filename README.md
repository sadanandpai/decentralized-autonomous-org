### Welcome to Decentralized Autonomous Organization

DAO is an acronym for decentralised autonomous organisation. It is the web3 scheme for a way a decentralised company should run. In a DAO all decisions are based on a quorum and all money flow is on the blockchain. This is a Dapp that DAOs can use for proposing and voting on decisions.



- Stage 0: A user must be inducted as a member of the DAO with their profile. The profile must be linked to the userâ€™s wallet and contain other information about them. Bonus points for a well-rounded profile with a profile picture and other data (stored in a decentralised manner).

- Stage 1: One member can initiate a proposal by uploading the necessary details. This proposal may have attachments and several descriptive fields. Remember all data must be stored in a decentralised manner.

- Stage 2: Once a proposal is uploaded, the other members may be notified and the voting process begins. A time is set for all members to finish voting. After timeout voting closes and results are tallied. The voting period is extended if only less than 80% of the members have voted.

- Stage 3: The voting is transparent and all members will be able to see the results and the proposal is accepted or rejected based on a predetermined threshold majority.
